# SPARC Orchestrator Specific Memory
<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->
### [2025-04-29 19:03:56] Intervention: Incorrect Role Execution (Architecture Design)
- **Trigger**: User feedback after `attempt_completion` by Architect mode.
### [2025-04-29 19:05:21] Intervention: Delegation Denied - Insufficient Detail
- **Trigger**: User denial of `new_task` delegation to Architect mode.
- **Context**: SPARC attempted to delegate architecture design task after correcting previous role execution error. User feedback indicated the delegation message lacked sufficient detail ("more details in the instructions").
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged feedback, logged intervention, will update previous delegation status to 'failed' and craft a more detailed delegation message.
- **Rationale**: Effective delegation requires providing the target mode with comprehensive context, specific questions to address, clear deliverables, and explicit pointers to relevant information (including previous attempts or feedback).
- **Outcome**: Delegation attempt failed; preparing a more detailed retry.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure future `new_task` messages are significantly more detailed, anticipating the information needs of the target mode. [See Feedback: 2025-04-29 19:05:07]
- **Context**: SPARC switched to Architect mode to initialize Memory Bank, but Architect mode then proceeded to perform the architectural design task itself instead of SPARC delegating it.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged error, logged feedback, will now delegate the architecture task correctly via `new_task`.
- **Rationale**: SPARC Orchestrator must delegate tasks to appropriate modes, not execute them directly or allow modes switched to for utility purposes (like MB creation) to take over primary tasks without explicit delegation.
- **Outcome**: Corrective action initiated (delegation).
- **Follow-up**: Ensure future mode switches for utility tasks are followed by a switch back and proper delegation via `new_task`. Monitor SPARC behavior for adherence to delegation role. [See Feedback: 2025-04-29 19:03:42]
### [2025-04-29 21:01:14] Intervention: Oversized TDD Task Delegation
- **Trigger**: User Denial of `new_task`
- **Context**: Attempted to delegate implementation of all core components to `tdd` mode in a single task.
- **Action Taken**: Halted delegation. Logged feedback. Will revise delegation strategy.
- **Rationale**: Task scope was too large, violating modularity principles and user preference for incremental steps.
- **Outcome**: Delegation denied. Workflow adjusted.
- **Follow-up**: Break down TDD implementation into smaller, component-focused tasks. Re-delegate starting with a single component. [See Feedback: 2025-04-29 21:01:03]

## Delegations Log
### [2025-04-30 01:27:18] Task: Document Core System Usage and Structure
- Assigned to: docs-writer
- Description: Create user-facing documentation for the core Storage Hygiene system. Focus on:
    - **README.md:** Update or create a main `README.md` file. Include a project overview, installation instructions (setting up virtual environment, installing `requirements.txt`), basic usage of `main.py` via CLI (explaining arguments like `--config`, `--targets`, `--db-path`, `--dry-run`), and a brief explanation of the core workflow.
    - **Configuration:** Document the structure and options available in the `config.yaml` file (e.g., `scan_paths`, `staging_path`, `database_path`, `rules` thresholds and actions). Provide clear examples. This could be part of the README or a separate `docs/configuration.md`.
    - **Component Overview:** Briefly describe the role of each core component (`ConfigManager`, `MetadataStore`, `Scanner`, `AnalysisEngine`, `ActionExecutor`) and how they interact, referencing the architecture diagram (`docs/architecture/architecture_report.md`). This could be part of the README or a separate `docs/architecture_overview.md`.
    - **Staging Area:** Explain the purpose and structure of the staging directory.
- Expected deliverable: Updated/new Markdown documentation files (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/configuration.md`, `docs/architecture_overview.md`). Update `memory-bank/mode-specific/docs-writer.md`.

### [2025-04-29 23:48:33] Task: Comprehensive Testing of Integrated Workflow
- Assigned to: qa-tester
- Description: Perform comprehensive testing of the integrated workflow executed by `src/storage_hygiene/main.py`. Expand upon the initial integration test (`tests/integration/test_main_workflow.py`). Focus on verifying:
    - Correct behavior with different configuration files (`config.yaml`).
    - Handling of various file types and directory structures during scanning.
    - Accuracy of analysis rules (duplicates, size, age) based on configuration.
    - Correct execution of actions (`stage_duplicate`, `review_large`, `review_old`) in **both dry-run and non-dry-run modes**.
    - **For non-dry-run tests, ensure a safe test environment is used (e.g., temporary directories created and cleaned up via `pytest` fixtures or similar) to avoid modifying real user data.**
    - Error handling (e.g., invalid config, non-existent directories, file access errors during staging).
    - Correct functioning of CLI arguments.
- Expected deliverable: Expanded integration/E2E test suite (e.g., adding tests to `tests/integration/test_main_workflow.py` or creating new files in `tests/integration/`). A test report summarizing findings, passed/failed tests, and any identified bugs or areas needing refinement. Update `memory-bank/mode-specific/qa-tester.md`.
- Status: completed
- Completion time: [2025-04-30 01:25:52]
- Outcome: Successfully expanded integration tests (`tests/integration/test_main_workflow.py`) covering config variations, scanning edge cases, analysis rules, dry/non-dry run actions (using safe tmp_path fixtures), error handling, and CLI args. Fixed bugs in ActionExecutor (duplicate move prevention) and main.py (error exit code). All 46 tests pass. See qa-tester.md/tdd.md for details.

### [2025-04-29 23:30:54] Task: Integrate Core Components
- Assigned to: integration
- Description: Integrate the core components (`ConfigManager`, `MetadataStore`, `Scanner`, `AnalysisEngine`, `ActionExecutor`) into a functional workflow. Create a main script (e.g., `src/main.py` or similar) that initializes these components, orchestrates the process (load config, scan directories, analyze metadata, execute actions), and potentially includes basic command-line argument parsing (e.g., for config file path, target directories, dry-run flag). Ensure components are instantiated correctly and data flows between them as designed (Scanner -> MetadataStore, MetadataStore/ConfigManager -> AnalysisEngine, AnalysisEngine -> ActionExecutor). Focus on wiring components together; detailed UI/CLI is a later step.
- Expected deliverable: A main script (e.g., `src/main.py`) demonstrating the integrated workflow. Update `src/storage_hygiene/__init__.py` if necessary to expose components. Add integration tests if feasible within the scope. Update `memory-bank/mode-specific/integration.md`.
- Status: completed
- Completion time: [2025-04-29 23:47:31]

- Assigned to: tdd
- Description: Implement the `ActionExecutor` component using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach (London School). Focus on receiving candidate actions (from `AnalysisEngine`), retrieving configuration (e.g., staging directory path, dry_run setting from `ConfigManager`), and executing file system operations (staging duplicates/large/old files by moving them, potentially deleting files if configured). **Crucially, implement and test 'dry_run' functionality (ADR-005) where actions are logged but not executed.** Use `pseudocode/action_executor.pseudo` and its TDD anchors as a guide. Implement in Python using `pytest`. **Pay close attention to mocking file system operations (`os`, `shutil`) during testing.**
- Expected deliverable: Python source code (`src/storage_hygiene/action_executor.py`), corresponding test file (`tests/test_action_executor.py`) with passing tests covering core functionality (handling different action types, staging logic, deletion logic, dry_run mode, interaction with ConfigManager mock/stub, error handling for file operations).

### [2025-04-29 22:32:06] Task: TDD Implementation - Scanner
- Assigned to: tdd
- Description: Implement the `Scanner` component using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach (London School).
