# SPARC Orchestrator Specific Memory
<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->
### [2025-04-29 19:03:56] Intervention: Incorrect Role Execution (Architecture Design)
- **Trigger**: User feedback after `attempt_completion` by Architect mode.
### [2025-04-29 19:05:21] Intervention: Delegation Denied - Insufficient Detail
- **Trigger**: User denial of `new_task` delegation to Architect mode.
- **Context**: SPARC attempted to delegate architecture design task after correcting previous role execution error. User feedback indicated the delegation message lacked sufficient detail ("more details in the instructions").
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged feedback, logged intervention, will update previous delegation status to 'failed' and craft a more detailed delegation message.
- **Rationale**: Effective delegation requires providing the target mode with comprehensive context, specific questions to address, clear deliverables, and explicit pointers to relevant information (including previous attempts or feedback).
- **Outcome**: Delegation attempt failed; preparing a more detailed retry.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure future `new_task` messages are significantly more detailed, anticipating the information needs of the target mode. [See Feedback: 2025-04-29 19:05:07]
- **Context**: SPARC switched to Architect mode to initialize Memory Bank, but Architect mode then proceeded to perform the architectural design task itself instead of SPARC delegating it.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged error, logged feedback, will now delegate the architecture task correctly via `new_task`.
- **Rationale**: SPARC Orchestrator must delegate tasks to appropriate modes, not execute them directly or allow modes switched to for utility purposes (like MB creation) to take over primary tasks without explicit delegation.
- **Outcome**: Corrective action initiated (delegation).
- **Follow-up**: Ensure future mode switches for utility tasks are followed by a switch back and proper delegation via `new_task`. Monitor SPARC behavior for adherence to delegation role. [See Feedback: 2025-04-29 19:03:42]
### [2025-04-29 21:01:14] Intervention: Oversized TDD Task Delegation
- **Trigger**: User Denial of `new_task`
- **Context**: Attempted to delegate implementation of all core components to `tdd` mode in a single task.
- **Action Taken**: Halted delegation. Logged feedback. Will revise delegation strategy.
- **Rationale**: Task scope was too large, violating modularity principles and user preference for incremental steps.
- **Outcome**: Delegation denied. Workflow adjusted.
- **Follow-up**: Break down TDD implementation into smaller, component-focused tasks. Re-delegate starting with a single component. [See Feedback: 2025-04-29 21:01:03]

## Delegations Log
### [2025-04-29 21:32:24] Task: TDD Implementation - MetadataStore
- Assigned to: tdd
- Description: Implement the `MetadataStore` component using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach (London School). Focus on initializing the DuckDB database, creating/managing the `files` table schema, adding/updating file metadata records, and querying metadata based on criteria specified in the pseudocode. Use `pseudocode/metadata_store.pseudo` and its TDD anchors as a guide. Implement in Python using `pytest` and `duckdb`.
- Expected deliverable: Python source code (`src/storage_hygiene/metadata_store.py`), corresponding test file (`tests/test_metadata_store.py`) with passing tests covering core functionality (init, add/update, query).
