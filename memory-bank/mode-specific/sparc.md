# SPARC Orchestrator Specific Memory
<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->
### [2025-04-29 19:03:56] Intervention: Incorrect Role Execution (Architecture Design)
- **Trigger**: User feedback after `attempt_completion` by Architect mode.
### [2025-04-29 19:05:21] Intervention: Delegation Denied - Insufficient Detail
- **Trigger**: User denial of `new_task` delegation to Architect mode.
- **Context**: SPARC attempted to delegate architecture design task after correcting previous role execution error. User feedback indicated the delegation message lacked sufficient detail ("more details in the instructions").
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged feedback, logged intervention, will update previous delegation status to 'failed' and craft a more detailed delegation message.
- **Rationale**: Effective delegation requires providing the target mode with comprehensive context, specific questions to address, clear deliverables, and explicit pointers to relevant information (including previous attempts or feedback).
- **Outcome**: Delegation attempt failed; preparing a more detailed retry.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure future `new_task` messages are significantly more detailed, anticipating the information needs of the target mode. [See Feedback: 2025-04-29 19:05:07]
- **Context**: SPARC switched to Architect mode to initialize Memory Bank, but Architect mode then proceeded to perform the architectural design task itself instead of SPARC delegating it.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged error, logged feedback, will now delegate the architecture task correctly via `new_task`.
- **Rationale**: SPARC Orchestrator must delegate tasks to appropriate modes, not execute them directly or allow modes switched to for utility purposes (like MB creation) to take over primary tasks without explicit delegation.
- **Outcome**: Corrective action initiated (delegation).
- **Follow-up**: Ensure future mode switches for utility tasks are followed by a switch back and proper delegation via `new_task`. Monitor SPARC behavior for adherence to delegation role. [See Feedback: 2025-04-29 19:03:42]
### [2025-04-29 19:04:22] Task: Architecture Design - Storage Hygiene System
- Assigned to: architect
- Description: Design a high-level architecture for the Storage Hygiene System based on the initial user requirements (scanning local/external/cloud, analysis for deletion/migration, staging area, optional AI integration, cloud migration focus). Address component responsibilities, data flow, interfaces, and key considerations (security, scalability, error handling).
- Expected deliverable: Architecture diagrams (e.g., Mermaid), component specifications, data flow descriptions, and key decisions documented in `memory-bank/globalContext.md` (System Patterns, Decision Log) and `memory-bank/mode-specific/architect.md`.
- Status: failed (Denied: Insufficient Detail)
- Completion time: N/A
- Outcome: N/A
- Link to Progress Entry: N/A
### [2025-04-29 19:28:24] Task: Final Attempt - Exploratory Architecture w/ Full Context (Retry 5)
- Assigned to: architect
- Description: Perform a deeply exploratory and highly specific architectural design, **embedding the full original user request text** for complete context. Address previous feedback regarding lack of specificity and exploration. Brainstorm possibilities for vague requirements ("etc."), define metrics, evaluate alternatives, justify choices.
- Expected deliverable: Comprehensive, justified, *expanded* architecture plan documented in Memory Bank, addressing all points in the detailed `new_task` message (including analysis categories, corruption markers, disorganization metrics, UI, security, scalability, error handling, AI, cloud migration). Document in `memory-bank/globalContext.md` and `memory-bank/mode-specific/architect.md`.
- Status: completed
- Completion time: [2025-04-29 20:17:04]
- Outcome: Success. Comprehensive architecture report, ADRs, and MB updates produced. Key decisions include CLI interface, DuckDB metadata store, OS Keychain for secrets, generalized transfer rules. AI integration deferred to post-MVP.

### [2025-04-29 19:11:32] Task: Deeply Exploratory & Specific Architecture Design - Storage Hygiene System (Retry 4)
- Assigned to: architect
- Description: Perform a deeply exploratory and highly specific architectural design. Previous attempts were insufficient. **Crucially, you must go beyond the user's initial prompt, actively brainstorm and define possibilities where requirements are vague (e.g., "etc."), propose concrete metrics/heuristics, evaluate alternatives, and justify choices.**
- Expected deliverable: A comprehensive, justified, and *expanded* architecture plan documented in Memory Bank. This includes all previous deliverables PLUS explicit definition/exploration of analysis categories (beyond duplicate/large/old/corrupt - e.g., temporary files, cache files, specific project types, empty files?), corruption markers, "disorganization" metrics, specific UI interaction flows, detailed comparison of credential storage methods, specific parallelization strategies, concrete error handling examples, AI prompt strategies/data handling, cloud migration alternative mechanisms. All documented in `memory-bank/globalContext.md` and `memory-bank/mode-specific/architect.md`.
