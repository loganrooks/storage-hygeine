# Architect Feedback
<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->
### [2025-04-29 20:07:22] - User Feedback on Architecture Attempt 3
- **Source:** User rejection of `attempt_completion`.
- **Issue:** User requested a more detailed "results" completion message.
- **Action:** Expand the `attempt_completion` result message to provide a more comprehensive summary of the final architecture and deliverables.
### [2025-04-29 20:05:59] - User Feedback on Architecture Attempt 2
- **Source:** User rejection of `attempt_completion`.
- **Issue:** User questioned if ADRs needed updates based on recent refinements and asked for confirmation/clarification on midpoint sampling for media corruption detection.
- **Action:**
    - Explain why ADRs don't require updates (refinements are implementation details within existing component scope).
    - Confirm midpoint sampling is part of Level 3 corruption check.
    - Add explicit clarification about start/middle/end sampling points to `architecture_report.md` and `architect.md`.
### [2025-04-29 19:45:45] - User Feedback on Architecture Attempt 1
- **Source:** User rejection of `attempt_completion`.
- **Issue:** Initial architecture report and ADRs lacked sufficient detail. Component descriptions were too high-level. Did not explicitly embed diagrams/models in the report. Did not adequately discuss modularity, SPARC/TDD alignment, dependencies, or potential future features. UI decision (Web App) was incorrect; user prefers CLI-only. Cloud migration was too specific (OneDrive->GDrive) and should be generalized. Development plan missing.
- **Action:** Revise architecture significantly:
    - Switch to CLI-only interface.
    - Greatly expand detail in component specifications (internals, algorithms, libraries, errors).
    - Embed all diagrams, models, interfaces directly into the main report.
    - Add sections covering modularity, SPARC/TDD, dependencies, future features, and a development plan.
    - Generalize the migration feature to support configurable rules (source/dest/filters).
    - Update Memory Bank and ADRs accordingly.
