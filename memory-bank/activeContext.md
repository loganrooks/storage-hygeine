[2025-04-29 21:25:27] - TDD - TDD Cycle 6 (Credential Placeholders) - Green: Added test_get_credential_placeholder. Test passed immediately as the existing get() method returned the placeholder string correctly. All 6 tests pass.
[2025-04-29 21:23:39] - TDD - TDD Cycle 5 (Schema Validation) - Green: Added _validate_schema method with basic type check for 'analysis.min_file_size_mb'. All 5 tests pass.
[2025-04-29 21:23:11] - TDD - TDD Cycle 5 (Schema Validation) - Red: Added test_validate_config_schema_invalid_type expecting ConfigLoadError for wrong data type. Test failed as expected (no validation).
[2025-04-29 21:22:10] - TDD - TDD Cycle 4 (Invalid YAML) - Green: Modified _load_user_config to raise ConfigLoadError on yaml.YAMLError. All 4 tests pass.
[2025-04-29 21:21:48] - TDD - TDD Cycle 4 (Invalid YAML) - Red: Added test_handle_invalid_user_config_yaml expecting ConfigLoadError. Test failed as expected (exception not raised).
[2025-04-29 21:20:36] - TDD - TDD Cycle 3 (Missing User File) - Green: Added test_handle_non_existent_user_config. Test passed immediately as existing code already handled this case correctly.
[2025-04-29 21:19:31] - TDD - TDD Cycle 2 (User Config Override) - Green: Added _load_user_config and _merge_configs methods. Both tests now pass.
[2025-04-29 21:19:06] - TDD - TDD Cycle 2 (User Config Override) - Red: Added test_load_user_config_overrides_defaults. Test failed as expected (user config not loaded).
[2025-04-29 21:17:58] - TDD - TDD Cycle 1 (ConfigManager Defaults) - Green: Minimal ConfigManager class with hardcoded defaults and get() method passes test_load_default_config.
[2025-04-29 21:16:13] - TDD - TDD Cycle 1 (ConfigManager Defaults) - Red: Wrote failing test test_load_default_config in tests/test_config_manager.py. Pytest initially failed with ModuleNotFoundError.
